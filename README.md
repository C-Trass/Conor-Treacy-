Hi, I’m Conor 👋

I’m a molecular biophysicist working on fluorescence lifetime imaging,
mechanobiology, and quantitative microscopy.

I am a Research Fellow at Brunel University of London, in the Esposito
Quantitative Biology group.

Here you’ll find:
- FLIM and FRET analysis tools
- Data visualisation pipelines
- Reproducible imaging workflows

Most projects are research-grade, documented, and designed for reuse.
